A complete **logistics optimization project** showcasing data exploration, machine learning, and an interactive dashboard for **intelligent route planning**.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **three-stage workflow** that transforms raw logistics data into a functional app that helps optimize delivery routes based on **cost**, **time**, and **CO₂ emissions**.

| Stage | File | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 📊 1. Exploratory Data Analysis | `EDA_OFI.ipynb` | Cleaned and analyzed delivery data to uncover key operational insights. |
| 🤖 2. Smart Route Planner ML Pipeline | `Smart Route Planner ML Model Pipeline.ipynb` | Developed the multi-objective optimization logic for smart routing. |
| 🌐 3. Interactive Web App | `app.py` | Built a Streamlit dashboard to visualize and interact with optimized routes. |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understands delivery performance by region, vehicle type, and delay time.  
   - Identifies CO₂ patterns based on vehicle age and type.

2. **Model Pipeline**  
   - Applies a **weighted optimization algorithm** balancing three objectives:  
     - 💰 Cost  
     - ⏱️ Time  
     - 🌱 CO₂ Emissions  
   - Uses a **nearest-neighbor heuristic** to compute efficient delivery sequences.

3. **Streamlit Dashboard**  
   - Interactive filters for region and vehicle type  
   - KPIs: Total orders, customer satisfaction, and delivery success rate  
   - Charts for order status, CO₂ emissions, and delay distribution  
   - Real-time **route optimization** with a dynamic map and sequence display
